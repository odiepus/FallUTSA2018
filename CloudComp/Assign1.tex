\part{Ray Tracing Engine Performance}

\section{By Slots}

For the first experiment we ran the ray tracing program using two,
four, and six processes. In each case we were able to see faster ray
tracing times. We noticed as the number of processes went up, the
change in times became smaller. Increasing processes produced dimishing
returns. The time difference between two nodes and four node was 0.3565
seconds. The difference in time to complete between four nodes and
six nodes was 0.0114 seconds.

\section{By Node}

The ray tracing experiment with the by-node option led to greater
changes between the number of processes, but overall took longer to
complete. From two nodes to four nodes the ray tracing time difference
was 0.1987 seconds. And the difference between four nodes and six
nodes was 0.1683 seconds. Similar to the by-slot experiment, there
is a trend of deminishing returns.
